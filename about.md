# whoami?!

Since I was a little kid, I've loved computers. I used to beg my mom to let me play on her computer at a very early age. At 11 years of age, I wanted to know how computers were made and how they work. So I typed "how do computers work" on Google and that's where my journey began. I started learning how to code in Python, then C++, then Java, and I was completely addicted. Everything was so logical, and when it worked, damn... It was so cool! Then another topic caught my interest: InfoSec. 

I remember installing nmap for the first time and scanning my whole network for open ports, creating vulnerable virtual machines to learn more about bugs, etc. I was addicted again... And since then, I've never stopped. I love trying out new techniques, reading about others research, developing my own projects, etc. 

Even though the infosec and software engineering fields are the ones I'm most interested in, I enjoy learning any topic in tech. I'll use this blog to post about personal projects, rants, personal research, CTF writeups or anything that comes up to my mind. This will be my online home. 

Hope you like it :)
