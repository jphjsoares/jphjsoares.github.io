Since I was a little kid, I've loved computers. I used to beg my mom to let me play on her computer at a very early age. At 11 years of age, I wanted to know how computers were made and how  they work. So I typed "how computers work" on Google and that's where my journey began. I started learning how to code in Python, then C++, then Java, and I was completely addicted. Everything was so logical, and when it worked, damn... It was so cool! Then another topic caught my interest: Cyber Security. 
I remember installing nmap for the first time and scanning my whole network for open ports, creating vulnerable virtual machines to learn more about bugs, etc. I was addicted again... And since then, I've never stopped. Never will, I'm completely passionate about this world. To know more than the average person. To strive everyday to become better and better at this art we call hacking.
On this blog, I will post software / InfoSec projects, personal research and CTF writeups. Hope you enjoy!
