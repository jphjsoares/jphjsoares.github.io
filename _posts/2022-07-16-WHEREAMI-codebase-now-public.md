title: WHEREAMI codebase now public
published: true
---

This summer, from now on, WHEREAMI codebase will be publicly available for everyone to check out! I am aware that there are some API keys for some services not hidden. But that's not a problem since those are free services. Therefore, they are nothing to worry about. On the front end, there's no way to hide such keys, and since many API calls come from the JavaScript UI, it's not possible to hide them. 
If you see something that must be changed, protected, etc. Feel free to drop me a message or submit a PR!
Thanks!
